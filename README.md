# This is the first personal project for Boot.Dev
This is my first Boot.Dev Personal Project!

It's a Parts Organizer Inventory Log. 

Have you been frustrated when you run out of 1/4-20 screws out without even realizing it? Or maybe you can't figure out where those M3 nuts are that you use once a year? This will help keep you and your parts organizer... well... ORGANIZED!

You simply run the program and you are greeted with a prompt to create a new organizer with the name and number of rows and columns OR you can load an already saved organizer that is saved locally to your machine. You can increment or decrement the qty of the bin and rename each bin as you please!
